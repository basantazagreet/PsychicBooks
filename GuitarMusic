Try covering these songs on guitar (Mostly guitar solo)


Remember "Rock music" ruled the world from the beginning when recording was invented. Rock music is the way no matter how far you have come. Because
rock music is lost, our current music has lost its track (2024), there were some good music till 2015 AD but most music today is bad. Therefore, Listen
to rock music. If you don't find it interesting, try "Pink Floyd" songs when you smoke weed. I will post all the top songs that I used to develop my
